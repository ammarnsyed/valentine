        <h2>Hi Babypie! 💖</h2>
        <p>
            It's Sheru, I just wanted to say a few words from my side. You have been an amazing girlfriend, 
            best friend, and partner anyone could ever ask for. I can't believe you are with me and so supportive in everything. 
            I love you so much I cannot even express it into words. I wish you were here to celebrate this day together, I miss you so much!
        </p>
        <p>
            I am so glad you got a job and are killing it in India! You deserve the best and more. 
            You are extremely capable and amazing, and don't let anyone tell you otherwise. You are my boss babe.
        </p>
        <p>
            Can't wait till you're back here and are leading companies, my lil smarty pants. That way you can get me a job hahahaha.
            Anyways, I just wanted to write this letter to show my love and appreciation for you. You are the best, Pookie! 💕
        </p>
        <p><b>PS:</b> I will be getting you flowers and chocolates as well when you move to your new office, so don’t think this is the only gift! 😉</p>
        <p><b>Yours Truly,<br>Sheru</b></p>
